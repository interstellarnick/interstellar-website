Confidentiality</h3><ol><li><p>Confidential Information. Each party (the &ldquo;Disclosing Party&rdquo;) may from time to time during the term of this Agreement disclose to the other party (the &ldquo;Receiving Party&rdquo;) certain information regarding the Disclosing Party’s business, including, without limitation, technical, marketing, financial, employee, planning and other confidential or proprietary information, which information is either marked as confidential or proprietary (or bears a similar legend) or which a reasonable person would understand to be confidential given the circumstance and nature of the disclosure (&ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo;), and whether disclosed orally or in writing. Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is in the Receiving Party’s possession at the time of disclosure as shown by credible evidence; (ii) before or after it has been disclosed to the Receiving Party, enters the public domain, not as a result of any action or inaction of the Receiving Party; (iii) is approved for release by written authorization of the Disclosing Party; (iv) is disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third-party not in violation of any obligation of confidentiality; or (v) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, as evidenced by such party’s written records.</p></li><li><p>Protection of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party will not use any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose other than performing its obligations or exercising its rights under this Agreement, and will disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party only to Receiving Party’s employees, agents, directors, officers, auditors, regulators and contractors on a &ldquo;need to know&rdquo; basis, provided such persons are under a contractual obligation with Receiving Party to maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information, which obligation is consistent with, and no less protective of Confidential Information, than the terms of this Section 13. The Receiving Party will protect the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner as the Receiving Party protects its own confidential or proprietary information of a similar nature and with no less than reasonable care. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information may be disclosed as required by law or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction. In such event and if reasonably possible under the circumstances of disclosure, the Receiving Party will provide the Disclosing Party with prompt prior notice of such obligation in order to permit the Disclosing Party an opportunity to take legal action to prevent or limit the scope of such disclosure, including the opportunity to seek a protective order. Unauthorized disclosure or use of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which recovery of money damages would be inadequate; consequently, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to timely injunctive relief to protect its rights under this Section 13, without the necessity of posting a bond therefore, in addition to any and all remedies available at law or in equity.</p></li></ol><h3 id=14-terms-and-termination>14.
